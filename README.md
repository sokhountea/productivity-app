# Productivity App
Developed a responsive productivity application that includes a Reminders section and a Notes section. It keeps track of tasks and notes by using local storage. Designs inspired by Apple.

For the Reminders, you can:
- Add/Edit/Delete tasks
- Add/Edit/Delete lists
- View which tasks are due today
- View all lists and tasks

For the Notes, you can:
- Add/Edit/Delete notes
- Edit styling (i.e. heading, body, italic, bold) in a note
- Add lists in a note
